my list of issues right now is thus:
- monsters are spawning in the right position from the entity data, but they fall through the floor and out of the world
- weapon viewmodel bob doesn't work on trisoup levels (probably FL_ONGROUND flag)
- dunno how to do anything related to dynamix vertex lighting
